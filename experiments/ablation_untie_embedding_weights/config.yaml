# The goal of this experiment is to compare model performance when embedding weights are not tied to the final linear layer.

sample_temperature: 0.1 # exploit memorization by using low temperature
training_data_char_limit: 5000 # limit training data to 5k characters to encourage overfitting
tie_embedding_weights: false
