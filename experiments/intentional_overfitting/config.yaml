# The goal of this experiment is to verify if model can succesfully memorize the small training dataset by intentionally
# overfitting it. It should be able to generate training samples verbatim at training loss around ~0.02.

sample_temperature: 0.1 # exploit memorization by using low temperature
training_data_char_limit: 5000 # limit training data to 5k characters to encourage overfitting
