# The goal of this experiment to compare model performance when no residdual connections are used.

sample_temperature: 0.1 # exploit memorization by using low temperature
training_data_char_limit: 5000 # limit training data to 5k characters to encourage overfitting
use_residual_connections: false
num_transformer_layers: 3 # model wouldn't converge with when there are >2 layers without residual connections
